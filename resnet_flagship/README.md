## Results

**Test Accuracy:** 81.49% (on controlled test set)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Performance Note:**  
The model performs well on images similar to the training distribution (Oxford Flowers-102 dataset) but struggles with real-world photos that have different lighting, angles, or backgrounds. This gap between test accuracy and real-world performance is a common challenge in production ML systems.
